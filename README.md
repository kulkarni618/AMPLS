# AMPLS
AMPLS: Autonomous helicopter landing on naval vessels in severe sea states (6.5-7). Built in Unity 3D with ML-Agents (IL/RL), it uses LSTM for ship motion prediction &amp; quiescent periods, ensuring precise 3-point touchdowns. Models exported in ONNX for real-world integration. Revolutionizing maritime safety.
